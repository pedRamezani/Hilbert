# Hilbert RickRoll
This is a animated space-filling Hilbert Curve in Processing.

The first three quarters of the curve are colored black, but the last quarter reveals a still image of [Rick Astley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

There are some settings you can change by changing variable values:

1. **lerpStep**: Reduce/Increase it to make the curve smoother/dotted and make the animation run faster/slower
2. **onlyTopRightCorner**: Set this value to false if you want to reveal the image over the whole curve
3. **skipNodes** and **skipAmount**: if skipNodes is true, every skipAmount-th Node will be skipped

Have fun. You can see this program in action [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8kqPysPdA0) (edited for entertainment purposes).
